# cam02-color-schemer

A tool for creating color schemes, built on the CIECAM02 color appearance model.

[CIECAM02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02) was built with a deep physiological understanding of how the eye and brain actually perceive, *plus* a whole lot of math that I don’t understand. This lil’ color schemer was built on [Connor Gramazio](gramaz.io)’s implementation of CIECAM02 in [D3](https://d3js.org), and I can’t explain [what CIECAM02 is](gramaz.io/d3-cam02/#ciecam02) (or show you [how much better it is at blending colors](http://gramaz.io/d3-cam02/#cam02vsLab)) any better than he does.
